About
=====
**mutrics**: open source network traffic classifier in Python, a reference
implementation of the Waterfall architecture.

The classifier takes as input ARFF files generated with [the Flowcalc
program](http://mutrics.iitis.pl/flowcalc). **mutrics** classifies network
traffic flows basing on many levels of traffic analysis and outputs the results
in either ARFF or TXT file format.

The classifier consists of many modules, which should be trained separately.
See respective directories for supportive scripts that train and test a
particular model.

Classification modules
================

The following modules are available in the implementation:
* **dstip**: quick classification by destination IP address
* **dnsclass**: [the DNS-Class algorithm](http://mutrics.iitis.pl/dns-class)
* **portsize**: quick classification by port number and payload size
* **npkts**: classification by payload sizes of 4 first packets, using random forest
* **port**: classical, quick classification by the port number
* **stats**: classification by statistics of packet sizes and inter-arrival times, using random forest
* **dpi**: classification by DPI payload analysis, using random forest
